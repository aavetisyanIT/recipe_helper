# recipe_helper

1. Overall Architecture
   1.1. Frontend: User Interface: Developed with a modern frontend framework/library React.
   User Experience: Provides functionalities like recipe browsing, search, user registration, login, and interaction with recipes.

1.2. Backend: API Server: Built with Node.js and Express to handle HTTP requests.
Authentication: JWT-based authentication for secure user access.
Business Logic: Handles recipe management, user profiles, and interactions (e.g., comments, ratings).
Data Storage: PostgreSQL for relational data (users, recipes, comments, ratings).

1.3. Database: PostgreSQL: Manages structured data, relationships between users, recipes, and comments.

1.4. Optional Services: File Storage: For storing recipe images (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
Caching: To improve performance (e.g., Redis).
Email Service: For notifications (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun).

2. Detailed Components
   2.1. Frontend - React

Components: Home page, recipe detail page, user profile, search functionality, and recipe creation form.
State Management: Handles application state and user data.
2.2. Backend (Node.js, Express)

Routes: Define endpoints for CRUD operations on recipes, user authentication, and comments.
Controllers: Implement business logic for each endpoint.
Middleware: For authentication, validation, and error handling.
Database Models: Define schemas and relationships for users, recipes, comments, and ratings.
2.3. Database (PostgreSQL)
Tables:
Users: UserID, username, email, hashedPassword, etc.
Recipes: RecipeID, title, ingredients, instructions, authorID (foreign key), etc.
Comments: CommentID, recipeID (foreign key), userID (foreign key), content, etc.
Ratings: RatingID, recipeID (foreign key), userID (foreign key), ratingValue, etc.
Indexes: For optimizing queries, especially on search fields and foreign keys.

2.4. Authentication (JWT) Sign Up / Login: Users register or log in to get a JWT.
Token Validation: Middleware to protect routes and ensure users are authenticated.
2.5. Caching (Optional) Caching Layer: To cache frequently accessed data and improve response times.

3. Example Data Flow
   User Registration/Login:
   Frontend sends registration/login request to backend.
   Backend validates user credentials, creates JWT, and sends it back to frontend.
   Frontend stores JWT (usually in local storage) and includes it in subsequent requests.
   Recipe Management:

User creates a recipe via the frontend form.
Frontend sends a request to the backend API.
Backend validates the input, stores the recipe in PostgreSQL, and optionally uploads an image to the storage service.
Recipe Retrieval:

User requests recipes from the frontend.
Frontend sends a request to the backend API.
Backend fetches recipes from PostgreSQL, applies any filters or sorting, and sends the data back to the frontend.
Comments and Ratings:

User submits a comment or rating.
Frontend sends the data to the backend.
Backend validates and stores the comment/rating in PostgreSQL.

4. Security Considerations
   Data Validation: Ensure all inputs are validated to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
   Authentication: Use JWTs for secure user sessions.
   Authorization: Ensure users can only access their own data or public content as allowed.
   HTTPS: Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

5. Scalability and Performance
   Load Balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple server instances if needed.
   Database Optimization: Use indexing and query optimization techniques.
   Caching: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
